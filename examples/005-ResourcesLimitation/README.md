# Resources limitation

* By default, a POD will use as much CPU and memory as necessary to do its work.
  This can be managed by using memory and CPU requests and limits in ***pod.spec.containers.resources***. 
  (resources limitation are set on a per-container basis using resourses property)
  Memory, as well as CPU limits can be used.
* CPU limits are expressed in ***millicore*** or ***millicpu***, which is one thousands of a CPU core, that means that 500 millicore is half CPU core. 
* Memory limits can be set also. And they are converted to the ***--memory*** option that can be used by the Docker run command or anything similar.
* When being scheduled, the kube-scheduler ensures that the node that is running the PODS have all the requested resources available.
* So if a node doesn't have the resources, the POD won't run.


In the follow yaml file, for example
* for mysql container there is:
    * a request at least 64MB and a 1/4 of CPU.
    * We request at least 64Mi minimum to be able to execute.
    * We limit the memory usage to 128Mi maximum.
    * We limit the CPU usage half CPU time
