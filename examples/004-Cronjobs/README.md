# CronJobs
CronJobs are used for tasks that need to run on a regular basic at a specific time.
When running a CronJob a Job will be scheduled and when it start it run a POD.
## Example 1
We create a cron job which runs every two minutes.
***001-SimpleCronJob.yaml***
```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: "hello-cronjob"
spec:
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: busybox
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo hello from k8s cluster
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
when scheduled it start a POD which runs the described bash commands
```
# Deploy the cronjob
$ kubectl apply -f 001-SimpleCronJob.yaml
cronjob.batch/print-date created

# Check cronjob after 5 minutes. Is still scheduled
$ kubectl get cronjobs
